## Quantum destiny of Number

In quantum physics and cosmology, systems can evolve over time:

Some collapse into a stable state (like electrons settling into the ground state, or stars burning into white dwarfs).


Now imagine numbers as quantum particles traveling through the “digit-squared universe.”

Here’s the law of this universe:
- At each step, the particle (number n) transforms into the sum of the squares of its digits.
- The transformation repeats, step by step.

Two destinies are possible:

1. If the particle eventually collapses into the stable state 1, it becomes a blissful particle (like a star reaching peaceful stability).

2. If instead, the particle gets stuck in a loop of transformations, it’s a doomed particle (like light trapped forever orbiting a black hole).

**Your mission:**
Write an algorithm to determine whether a number will reach the stable quantum ground state (1) or remain trapped in an endless cycle.


Example :
```
Input:
19
2
```
```
Output:
true
false
```
