## Spaceship Thrusters

An astronaut is trying to dock their spaceship at Space Station B, but they currently start at position A along a space corridor.

The spaceship’s thrusters are a bit quirky:

- In one move, the astronaut can boost forward or backward by any distance between 1 and 10 light-units.

- Different boosts can be of different strengths (maybe 3 forward, then 7 backward, etc).

**The mission:**
Find the minimum number of thruster bursts required to exactly reach B from A.

**Example**
```
Input:
A B
5 15
20 4
30 30
```
```
Output:
1
2
0
```
